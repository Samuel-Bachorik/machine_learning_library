# Fully automatic backpropagation algorithm trough various linear layers, activation functions and loss function

How to change weights of the model to get better results? The right question is - what are derivatives of weights with respect to loss function?<br/>

Backpropagation alorithm implemented in this library will give you answer to this question. <br/>

Build your model, put your data inside, run backward, save model weights, load model weights and test trained model in real life<br/>
