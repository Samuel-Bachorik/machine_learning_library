# Fully automatic backpropagation algorithm trough various linear layers, activation functions and loss function

How to change weights of the model to get better results? The right question is - what is derivative of weights with respect to loss function?<br/>

Backpropagation alorithm implemented in this library will give you answer to this question. <br/>
